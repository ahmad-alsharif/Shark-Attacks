# Shark Attacks
#### - [Project Dataset]()

Shark attacks pose a significant concern for beachgoers, particularly surfers and swimmers. This project leverages a comprehensive dataset on global shark attacks to uncover patterns and trends. By examining variables such as location, fatality rate, and date, I aim to generate valuable insights that can help mitigate risks and enhance safety protocols for ocean enthusiasts.
